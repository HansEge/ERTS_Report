\chapter*{Abstract}
\textit{This project concerns hardware acceleration of a genetic search algorithm. The problem that the algorithm is trying to optimize is finding the shortest route between a series of points, which is often known as the "Traveling Salesman Problem"\cite{wiki:TSP}. By means of timing-analysis of an initial software-implementation of the algorithm, the most computationally heavy part of the code was identified as being the calculation of distances between points. Using Vivado HLS and SystemC, a hardware module that could provide this functionality was synthesized. The hardware acceleration of this functionality has been estimated to triple the amount of iterations pr. second from approximately 1900 to approximately 6200. It has been hypothesized that a hardware-acceleration of the creation of new generations could result in a further improvement in performance.}
