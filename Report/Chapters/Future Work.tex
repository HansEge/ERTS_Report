For future work it would make sense to look at the next bottleneck in the system. The first bottleneck in the system were as mentioned the calculation of distances between the locations. The next most computation heavy functionality is the creation of a new generation. So, the next step would be to examine the use of the “unroll”-directive to unroll the for-loop to generate the new generation to increase the performance in terms of calculation time.
