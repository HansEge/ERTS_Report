\subsection{Overview}
To give an overview of the software for the system a class diagram have been made. This can be seen on the figure below.
On class diagram have been developed based on the former domain problem analysis such as use cases. When a somewhat sufficient class diagram had been made it was used as a guideline for developing the system. Some changes have been made throughout the development when smarter options became apparent. \cref{fig:ClassDiagram} shows the latest class diagram for ROGSAnne.

As mentioned in the Design chapter a State Machine pattern has been chosen as a good fit for this system and a \textbf{SystemContext} class has been made to handle the holding and switching of states. The abstract class \textbf{Statebase} has virtual methods of each event needed for switching between states. Because StateBase is abstract each state class that inherits from the class needs to implement the it's method for changing state. I.e GenerationReady needs to implement FitnessCalculated() otherwise a default version will be called and an exception is called.

Each of the four states does the same thing as described under the design chapter, which is:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Setup}: Create initial population
	\item \textbf{GenerationReady}: Calculate distance and fitness of population
	\item \textbf{Evaluator}: Checks if there's been generated a better candidate solution, if not increment a counter. If this counter reaches a certain value, our stop condition is met and the program ends.
	\item \textbf{GenerationMaker}: Generate new population by taking the best of the population and use them as parents.
\end{itemize}
