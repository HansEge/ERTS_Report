\chapter{Requirements}

The following section will list the requirements the system has to meet. These requirements will be used as basis for the system architecture. The functional requirements will be listed and to define the interaction between the system and the user, for this use case is used. Non-functional requirements will also be listed in this section. 

\section{Functional requirements}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{[Func Req 1]} The system must be able to calculate an optimized route, by means of the genetic search algorithm.
	\item \textbf{[Func Req 2]} The system must be able to display the optimized route for the user
\end{itemize}

\end{table}


\section{Non-functional requirements}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{[non-func Req 1]} The algorithm must be stopped after not having found an improved solution in 19 iterations.
	\item \textbf{[non-func Req 2]} The coordinates of a locations the drone has to visit must be in 2 dimensions.  
	\item \textbf{[non-func Req 3]} The maximum number for locations the drone can visit on a single route is 10.
\end{itemize}
