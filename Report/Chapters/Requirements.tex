\chapter{Requirements}

The following section will list the requirements the system has to meet. These requirements will be used as basis for the system architecture. The functional requirements will be listed and to define the interaction between the system and the user use cases is used. Non-functional requirements will also be listed in this section. 

\section{Functional requirements}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{[Func Req 1]} The system must be able to calculate an optimized route
	\item \textbf{[Func Req 2]} The system must be able to display the optimized route for the user
\end{itemize}

		\cellcolor[HTML]{EFEFEF} \textbf{User} &  Drone Delivery Operator (DDO) \\ \hline
		\cellcolor[HTML]{EFEFEF} \textbf{End Objective} &  Get most optimized route\\ \hline
		\cellcolor[HTML]{EFEFEF} \textbf{Trigger} & All delivery coordinates have been uploaded to the optimization server \\ \hline 
		\cellcolor[HTML]{EFEFEF} \textbf{Pre-condition} & Drone is fully charged and in functional condition \\ \hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

		\cellcolor[HTML]{EFEFEF} Start optimization &  DDO presses “OPTIMIZE”  & System performs optimization on coordinates. \\ \hline
		\cellcolor[HTML]{EFEFEF} The drone route is updated   &     &  The system presents the optimized drone route for the DDO.  \\ \hline

\end{table}


\section{Non-functional requirements}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{[non-func Req 1]} The algorithm must be stopped after one of the two stopping 
	criteria is met. 
	\item \textbf{[non-func Req 2]} The coordinates of a locations the drone has to visit must be in 2 dimensions.  
	\item \textbf{[non-func Req 3]} The maximum number for locations the drone can visit on a single route is ten.
\end{itemize}
