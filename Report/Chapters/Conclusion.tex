\chapter{Conclusion}
In this project the group has examined different approaches to accelerate computational heavy software tasks. First a genetic search algorithm has been developed to run on the ZYBO board. When the system was fully operational the different tasks in the system was timed to see which was the most computational heavy. This was the calculation of distance between the different coordinates and thus this was picked to be hardware accelerated. 

The IP core has been coded and validated using systemC and synthesized in Vivado HLS. Directives has been used to optimize the latency. The UNROLL directive was used to greatly reduce the latency.

The end result is an optimized IP core that computes the distance in a fraction of the time compared to the software implementation.
