\chapter{Future Work}
For future work it would make sense to look at the next bottleneck in the system. The first bottleneck in the system were as mentioned the calculation of distances between the locations. The next most computation heavy functionality was the creation of a new generation. So, the next step would be to examine the use of the “unroll”-directive to unroll the generate a new generation for-loop to increase the performance in terms of calculation time.
